      arises as they are spotted by talibanis the movie is fully loaded with action and</br>
      was appreciated by most of the veterans as the combat scenes weren't exagerated</br>
      and it was appropriately shown how it feels when your are in the boots of a soldier</br>
   </p>
   <p>This Movie is about an amateur assistant basketball coach</br>

   <p>This Moive is based on the flood which happend in kerala in 2018</br>
      in this movie it is pretty meticulously shown how everyone faced</br>
      this natural calamity and how they overcame it.How the mighty    </br> 
      fishermen played a humongous role in evacuating the citizens to  </br>
      the camp .In the movie no actor can be said as a protagonist as  </br>
      the movie wasn't focused only on one character.It was pretty hard </br>
      to watch the movie without having wet eyes as the emotions were   </br>
      depicted accurately.The flood was simulated by the movie crew    </br>
      in an acre ground.Kudos to the team as it is the fastest 100 cr  </br>
      malayalam movie
